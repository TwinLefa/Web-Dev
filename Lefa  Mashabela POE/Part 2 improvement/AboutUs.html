<font size="5"><P>We pride ourselves in ensuring that women and children are protected at all times.We do not condone
abuse but instead we condemn it.We are very strict in protecting and providing support for survivors.
We are sick and tired of always reading about how a woman was bruatlly murdered,how a woman was terribly
raped and how a woman or a child had been abused and the justice system has failed them so we saw it best fit to try and 
make women understand that they are not alone and that there are people who care for them.<p>

<li>We believe in freedom of speech thus we provide a platform for victims's voices to be heard.</li><br>

<li>We deliver a needs led and strength based response to victims'.</li><br>

<li>Understanding why and what led them to stay even though they were suffering.</li><br>
