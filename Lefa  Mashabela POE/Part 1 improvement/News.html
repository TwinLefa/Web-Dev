            <h2>GBV 1</h2>
            <p>A total of 77 gender-based violence (GBV) cases reported over the last six months in the Mpumalanga have been struck off the court roll due to the inefficiency of the SA Police Service.
                "Investigators work under immense strain and at times they each sit with well over 200 dockets. This failure does however not justify their inability to comply with their oath and fulfil their constitutional mandate."

                Allen said he would engage provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembisile Patekile, as he needs to establish whether the officers that have failed the citizens will be held accountable, should this not have occurred yet.
